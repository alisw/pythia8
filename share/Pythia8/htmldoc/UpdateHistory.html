These update notes describe major updates relative to the 
PYTHIA 8.243 version, which was the last 8.2 release (so far). 
The step from 8.2 to 8.3 gave an occasion to break backwards 
compatibility. The main change is that C++11 is now assumed. 
The impact on existing used code should be mild, however.

<h3>8.302: 24 April 2020</h3> 
<ul> 
 
<li>A HepMC 3 interface is now included in 
<code>Pythia8Plugins/HepMC3.h</code>. All HepMC examples have been 
migrated from using the HepMC 2 interface to HepMC 3, excluding 
<code>main44.cc</code> and <code>main93.cc</code> which are kept for 
legacy purposes.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix to correct units for automated shower uncertainty weights 
for <code>lhaStrategy = &plusmn;4</code>. In addition, the 
combination of weight variations, within the context of uncertainty 
bands, was not previously well documented and was therefore prone to 
misunderstandings. Now, all methods related to cross sections and 
weights are documented together on a single page, 
<a href="CrossSectionsAndWeights.html" target="page">Cross Sections and Weights</a>, the 
documentation on shower <a href="Variations.html" target="page">Variations</a> has 
been improved, and the behaviour of 
<code>Info::getGroupWeight()</code> has been made more transparent. 
The <code>main121.cc</code> example has been modified 
accordingly. Note that the bug fix for <code>lhaStrategy = 
&plusmn;4</code> parallels an analogous one made in Pythia 8.244 which 
had not been previously carried over to Pythia 8.3.</li> 
 
<li>Fix for subscripting issue for photon beams, courtesy of Vittorio 
Zecca.</li> 
 
<li>New particle property directive <code>tauCalc</code> allows for a 
particle's proper lifetime to be set independently of its width.  This 
is useful for studying the effect of lifetime for a particle when the 
particle width is otherwise negligible.</li> 
 
<li>Significant speedup of parton distribution handling, and 
thereby of the whole PYTHIA execution, since PDF is such a major 
part of the total execution time. This has been achieved by 
careful work by Dmitri Konstantinov and Grigory Latyshev. 
In detail, the main changes are: 
<ul> 
<li>In the LHAPDF6 interface the evaluation of the <i>x</i> and 
<i>Q^2</i> limits is extremely slow, such that a caching of these 
numbers increases execution speed by about a factor of 2 when LHAPDF 
is used.</li> 
<li>A caching of info on the amount of <i>x</i> already used up 
helps speed up MPI, ISR and FSR execution times, giving gains of 
order 20%. Main changes are in the <code>BeamParticle</code> class. 
</li> 
<li>Optimization of array handling in <code>LHAGrid1</code> give 
a speedup by about 5%. This is the internal PYTHIA implementation 
of interpolation in LHAPDF6 grids which, still after the LHAPDF6 
improvements reported above, runs more than 50% faster than using 
the same PDF evaluated by LHAPDF6. This streamlining is made at 
the cost of not offering facilities like PDF error bands.</li> 
<li>Also the special internal routines for the NNPDF 2.3 series 
could be speeded up, but would still be slower than an equivalent 
<code>LHAGrid1</code> implementation. The NNPDF 2.3 sets therefore 
have been moved to the latter framework.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>New base class <code>ShowerModel</code> introduced, as a 
top-level handler of parton-shower models, interfaced via a shared 
pointer in <code>Pythia.cc</code>. 
Changes to Pythia's default showers 
and to the Vincia and Dire shower models to inherit from 
<code>ShowerModel</code>. New public method 
<code>Pythia::getShowerModelPtr()</code> intended to provide a way 
to access public ShowerModel methods for diagnostics purposes. 
</li> 
 
<li>Extra protection against unexpected input in <i>e+e-</i> Les 
Houches events, specifically where <i>x >= 1</i> by roundoff errors. 
Thanks to Alexander Belyaev, Alexander Pukhov and Marco Zaro.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix in 
<code>SusyLesHouches::checkSpectrum()</code>, to ensure uniform 
error handling when one or more spectrum self-consistency checks fails. 
</li> 
 
<li>Replaced use of <code>fabs()</code> by <code>abs()</code> 
in several places. Although default C++ <code>abs()</code> only takes 
integer arguments, <code>PythiaStdLib.h</code> contains the 
declaration <code>using std::abs</code> (via the <code>cmath</code> 
header), which is suitably overloaded and obviates the need for 
separate methods. 
</li> 
 
<li>Improvements to Vincia's handling of error messages; 
now issued via <code>Info::errorMsg()</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Removed <code>share/Pythia8/tunes</code> directory, 
with Vincia reverting to the same (in-code) way of setting tune 
presets as Dire and Pythia.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<a name="section1"></a> 
<h3>8.301: 30 October 2019</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Compilation is done with a new <code>-std=c++11</code> flag.</li> 
 
<li>The Vincia and Dire parton-shower programs, which previously have 
been available as free-standing add-ons to Pythia, are now fully 
integrated into Pythia, and will henceforth be distributed as part of 
this package. This has significant implications for code and 
documentation. The new master switch 
<code><a href="PartonShowers.html" target="page">PartonShowers:model</a></code> 
allows a simple choice of which to use, with 1 being the simple old 
internal one, 2 being Vincia and 3 being Dire. Note that Dire always 
comes with weighted events, while the other two by default have unit 
weight events, so analysis strategies must be adjusted accordingly. 
</li> 
 
<li>MadGraph-generated plugins for matrix element corrections to the 
Vincia and Dire parton-shower programs are now available. A new 
plugins directory has been created, where MadGraph5 matrix elements 
can be stored. Note that this implementation still is preliminary, 
with further improvements to come. To build the available plugins, 
<code>--enable-mg5mes</code> should be specified.</li> 
 
<li>Four new main programs have been introduced in the context of 
illustrating the Vincia and Dire shower models. Two of them also serve 
as examples of multithreading if Pythia is configured to link to 
OpenMP. <code>main200.cc</code> provides a simple test of final-state 
shower components, in a LEP-like setup. <code>main201.cc</code> 
compares two different shower models on dijet events. The two runs 
are executed in parallel if Pythia has been configured to link to 
OpenMP. <code>main202.cc</code> measures the running time for ttbar 
events and outputs a few test distributions. <code>main300.cc</code> 
can be linked against both HepMC2 and OpenMP, if Pythia has been 
configured correspondingly. It is capable of command-line 
instructions.</li> 
 
<li>A new plugin header, <code>Visualisation</code> is available and 
used in the example program <code>main300.cc</code>. Events can now be 
visualized via output that can be passed through GraphViz to produce a 
postscript file.</li> 
 
<li>Introduced a compromise for the treatment of lifetime and width, 
so that these can be set separately in some situations. If an 
<code>SLHA</code> file is used to set particle properties, then 
<code>SLHA:allowUserOverride = true</code> allows the lifetime to be 
set using a command file/string.  Otherwise, lifetime is calculated 
from particle width. The ability to have the width and lifetime as 
independent properties is convenient for studies of new physics.</li> 
 
<li>The HTML and XML versions of the manual have been significantly 
reordered, with contents grouped in an increased set of main headings, 
each with an expandable index of subheadings. There are several new 
sections, notably for the Vincia and Dire showers. Among other changes, 
the example main programs have been classified by keywords, and are 
listed and searchable by these, see 
<a href="ExampleKeywords.html" target="page">here</a>.</li> 
 
<li>The PHP version of the manual has been discontinued, since it 
would be difficult to maintain in conjuction with the ongoing expansion 
of the html manual. The <code>include/Pythia8/phpdoc</code> 
directory has been removed.</li> 
 
<li>The Python interface has been completely redesigned to handle 
<code>C++11</code> by migrating from a <code>SWIG</code> generated 
interface to a <code>PyBind11</code> one. It is now possible for 
users to generate their own interface. Full details are given on the 
<a href="PythonInterface.html" target="page">Python Interface</a> page.</li> 
 
<li>The field <code>Pythia::info</code> of type <code>Info</code> has 
been made a constant reference, so that it cannot be externally 
manipulated outside of the internal classes. This constant reference 
points back to <code>Pythia::infoPrivate</code> instance, which is 
for internal use only.  This instance now also contains pointers to 
several other commonly used classes.</li> 
 
<li>A new base class <code>PhysicsBase</code> has been created, from 
which several of the "physics" classes derive. This class standardizes 
the setup of pointers to commonly used classes, via the 
<code>Info</code> class. It has new methods that are called at the 
beginning and end of the generation of each event, and at the printout 
of final statistics. A new enum <code>Status</code> is provided in the 
method at the end of each event, to provide information on the reason 
for error exits. The access of the most commonly used 
<code>Settings</code> methods is streamlined.</li> 
 
<li>Most of the pointers in the <code>Pythia</code> class are now 
shared pointers, such that there is no need for <code>Pythia</code> to 
keep track of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> 
obligations. New header <code>SharedPointers.h</code>.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>CoupSM</code> and <code>CoupSUSY</code> couplings 
classes are now separated, rather than the latter being derived from 
the former.  This avoids the problem of the old <code>Couplings</code> 
pointer potentially changing address, and some pointer casting.</li> 
 
<li>Mathematical functions and methods have been extracted from the 
<code>PythiaStdlib.h/.cc</code> files and put in new 
<code>MathTools.h/.cc</code> files. Thereby <code>PythiaStdlib</code> 
is more clearly reserved for declarations related to the Stdlib 
library, to some simple inline expressions (now <code>constexpr</code> 
where feasible) and to an expanded list of conversion constants.</li> 
 
<li>A new method <code>Rndm::phaseSpace2</code> has been added, and can be 
used to sample two-body phase space.</li> 
 
<li>The heavy ion machinery has been fixed so that particle vertex 
information in the event record is stored in units of <em>mm</em> 
rather than <em>fm</em>, while internal calculations still are in 
<em>fm</em>. Thanks to Christopher Plumberg.</li> 
 
<li>The data files related to parton distributions have been moved to 
a new <code>share/pythia8/pdfdata</code> directory, and code has been 
changed accordingly.</li> 
 
<li>Iterators are made available to simplify the study of the particles 
in the event record.</li> 
 
<li>A bug in the XML-to-HTML conversion has led to the indiscriminate 
removal of "more" from the HTML manual, notably in 
<code>Pythia::moreDecays()</code>.</li> 
 
<li>New class <code>LowEnergyProcess</code> for the hadronization of 
low-energy collisions between two hadrons. By default there is a smooh 
transition between this simple nonperturbative model and the full 
MPI-based framework at higher energies. To be used e.g. within the 
modelling of hadronic rescattering in the final state of high-energy 
collisions.  This framework is still under development.</li> 
 
<li>New <code>StringInteractions</code> base class to provide common 
administrative framework for string shoving, rope hadronization, 
swing, (some) colour reconnection models, and more.</li> 
 
<li>The headers in <code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> have been 
updated to no longer contain <code>using namespace Pythia8</code>. 
Thanks to Axel Naumann for pointing out inconsistent usage of scope. 
</li> 
 
<li>The build system has been updated to handle external package 
configuration scripts.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>ProMC</code> example and configuration option has been 
dropped.</li> 
 
<li>Optional package configurations for <code>RIVET</code> and 
<code>YODA</code> have been added.</li> 
 
<li>Support for <code>BOOST</code> has been dropped and only 
<code>LHAPDF6</code> with versions greater than <code>6.2</code> are 
supported.</li> 
 
<li>The flag <code>--openmp</code> has been added. Currently, OpenMP 
is used in some of the examples mentioned above, and in 
<code>DireWeightContainer.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix so the option <code>UncertaintyBands:ISRpTmin2Fac</code> 
is correctly used in <code>SimpleSpaceShower.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix stopping growth of number weights when multiple 
<code>init</code> calls are made in <code>Info</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix for <code>SusyWidthFunctions.cc</code> incorrectly calling 
<code>integrateGauss</code>, resulting in a width of zero.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix to prevent overwriting of dark matter masses from unused 
model selections.</li> 
 
<li> Bug fix where instead of counting all PDG ids less than 100 as 
the Standard Model, masses of BSM Higges and dark matter are allowed 
to be set without changing minMassSM.</li> 
 
<li> All 2 to 2 SUSY processes now inherit from Sigma2SUSY.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix for Les Houches Event File input without specified beams, 
such that multiparton decays of a resonance can be combined with 
showers, although with proper care needed so as not to doublecount 
emissions.</li> 
 
<li>Clarify that Q2 scale has to be set by hand for DIS processes, if 
so desired.</li> 
</ul>
