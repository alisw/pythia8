POWHEG [<a href="Bibliography.html#refNas04" target="page">Nas04</a>] in its character is very much like a parton shower, 
with a Sudakov factor arising from the ordering of emissions. Both 
POWHEG-BOX [<a href="Bibliography.html#refAli10" target="page">Ali10</a>] and PYTHIA are based on a combined evolution 
of ISR and FSR in <i>pT</i>-related "hardness" variables, and thus are 
kindred spirits. The hardness definitions differ, however. Frequently we 
will therefore need to distinguish between POWHEG-hardness and 
PYTHIA-hardness in the following. 
 
<a name="section0"></a> 
<h3>Naive POWHEG Matching (Not Recommended)</h3> 
<p/> 
The simplest merging solution would be if there was no difference 
between POWHEG-hardness and PYTHIA-hardness. Then, the PYTHIA shower 
could simply be continued at the LHA <code>scale</code> hardness 
where POWHEG leaves off. This behaviour (which would only be correct 
if the hardness definitions were really identical) is obtained if you 
set 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>TimeShower:pTmaxMatch = 1</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch = 1</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>Vincia:pTmaxMatch = 1</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
Note 1: the last line is only needed if you intend to use the VINCIA 
shower model. 
<br/> 
Note 2: if you have loaded the POWHEG hooks (see below), you should also 
use the setting <code>POWHEG:veto = 0</code> to deactivate the POWHEG hooks. 
 
<p/> 
The reason we do not recommend these settings (naive POWHEG matching) 
for serious studies is of course that POWHEG-hardness and 
PYTHIA-hardness are not identical, and hence mismatches are bound to 
happen: some phase-space regions may be doublecounted, while others 
may not be counted at all. Depending on the process and the choice of 
hardness, such mismatches might be small, but there are no guarantees. 
 
<a name="section1"></a> 
<h3>POWHEG Matching with Vetoed Showers (Recommended)</h3> 
<p/> 
A (hopefully) more accurate merging 
scheme is coded up in the <code>include/Pythia8Plugins/PowHegHooks.h</code> 
file, with a realistic user example in the <code>examples/main31</code> 
files. Here we would like to discuss the (POWHEG-specific) input settings 
for <code>main31.cc</code>, see <code>main31.cmnd</code>, and attempt to 
give some recommendations on how to use the main program to perform a 
matching of POWHEG-BOX with PYTHIA 8. 
 
<p/> 
POWHEG-BOX inputs contain Born-like events (with no resolved emission) and 
Real-type events (containing an additional parton). The mismatch between 
POWHEG-hardness and PYTHIA-hardness can be minimised if the PYTHIA shower 
knows 
<br/>a) The POWHEG-hardness criterion (through which the separation of Born- 
and Real-like events is defined), and 
<br/>b) The POWHEG-hardness value (which separates Born- and Real-like 
events). 
<br/>If these definitions are known, then 
PYTHIA can fill missing phase space regions through vetoed showering: let 
the shower sweep over the full phase space, using its PYTHIA-hardness 
ordering, and use the POWHEG-hardness to veto those emissions that POWHEG 
should already have covered. This is only possible since the 
POWHEG-hardness criterion and the shower ordering criterion are very 
similar. In the more general case a truncated showering would be needed 
[<a href="Bibliography.html#refNas04" target="page">Nas04</a>]. 
 
<p/> 
For vetoed showering, it is necessary to define the POWHEG-hardness 
criterion. In the presence of multiple partons, the definition 
quickly becomes complicated, and allows for different choices. Similar 
decisions have already been made in the implementation of POWHEG, one example 
being the choice in defining which "hardness value" is transferred as 
POWHEG-hardness, e.g. by deciding if the "singular regions" of the FKS or the 
CS approach are used. If the POWHEG-hardness definition were to be changed, 
or extended to more objects, the <code>PowhegHooks.h</code> code would need 
to be modified accordingly. 
 
<p/> 
The merging code is designed to be very flexible, and allows access to 
many possible choices. However, this flexibility means that many 
parameters can be changed, potentially leading to confusion. Thus, 
recommendations might prove helpful. All mistakes and inaccuracies 
rest with the author. 
 
<p/> 
We recommend the usage of vetoed showers. This means using 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>TimeShower:pTmaxMatch = 2</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch = 2</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>Vincia:pTmaxMatch = 2</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>POWHEG:veto = 1</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
The three first statements mean that PYTHIA's showers will sweep over 
the full phase space, while the last statement will tell the POWHEG 
hooks to apply a veto on shower emissions for which the 
POWHEG-hardness separation between radiator and emission is above the 
POWHEG-hardness value of the current input event. 
 
<p/> 
To obtain an estimate of the systematic uncertainty of the POWHEG matching 
procedure, we recommend varying the hardness value that is 
associated with the branching that is generated by POWHEG, against 
which emissions in the vetoed shower are tested. The scale at which 
POWHEG generated the emission is transferred by POWHEG-BOX in the 
<code>SCALUP</code> member of Les Houches Events. This is taken as the 
value that will define the POWHEG-hardness criterion for the vetoed 
shower if <code>POWHEG:pThard = 0</code>. 
However, as promoted in [<a href="Bibliography.html#refOle12" target="page">Ole12</a>], 
the POWHEG-hardness scale can also be recalculated, either as the lowest 
possible scale at which POWHEG could have produced the same emission, 
<code>POWHEG:pThard = 1</code>, 
or as the lowest scale at which POWHEG could have produced the same 
event, <code>POWHEG:pThard = 2</code>. As a rule, higher values of 
<code>POWHEG:pThard</code> suppresses the probability of further 
emissions. Currently, we recommend using 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>POWHEG:pThard = 1</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
as the central setting, and using <code>POWHEG:pThard = 0,2</code> 
to estimate the POWHEG matching uncertainties associated with this choice. 
 
<p/> 
A comparison with the naive POWHEG matching settings above may also be 
informative, to assess how much phase space is under- or 
double-counted, i.e., to gauge the effect of the hardness mismatch, 
but would probably be overkill in the context of uncertainty estimates. 
 
<p/> 
To define the POWHEG-hardness criterion 
(see also the <a href="#settings">full list of settings</a> below), use 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>POWHEG:pTdef = 1</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
Alternatively,  the PYTHIA hardness can be used instead, with 
<code>POWHEG:pTdef = 2</code>. Again, this may be overkill in the 
context of uncertainty estimates. 
 
<p/> 
Both POWHEG-BOX and PYTHIA 8 generate emissions through a parton-shower 
step, meaning that both programs have a clear definition of a radiator 
that emits particles, which is very similar (if not identical). 
To fix the ambiguity if the radiator or the emitted particle should be 
called "the emission", use 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>POWHEG:emitted = 0</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
More complicated choices can be used by experts. For instance, use 
<code>POWHEG:emitted = 2</code> to check the POWHEG-hardness of both 
radiator and emitted. 
 
<p/> 
To exhaustively fix the criterion by which to veto parton shower 
emissions, it is important to decide which partons/parton pairs 
are used to calculate the POWHEG hardness of a PYTHIA 8 emission. 
The minimal and recommended choice is 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>POWHEG:pTemt = 0</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
This means that only the POWHEG hardness with respect to the radiating leg 
is checked, and recoil effects are neglected. This prescription should be 
very similar to how a hardness value is assigned to a Real-type event 
in the POWHEG-BOX, since in the (implementation of FKS in the) POWHEG-BOX, 
initial state splittings only have singular regions with the radiating 
initial state parton, and final state splittings only have singular 
regions with respect to the radiating final state line. Other choices of 
<code>POWHEG:pTemt</code> are available. A warning is that the impact 
of changes can be huge, particularly for inputs with many jets. Other 
choices therefore should only be made by experts, and a high degree of 
caution is advised. 
 
<p/> 
For many POWHEG processes, the Sudakov effects from electroweak 
emissions (here we are concerned mainly with photon emissions, but this could 
apply also to W/Z emissions) are not included. This effect can be 
investigated using <code>POWHEG:QEDveto = 0,1,</code> or <code>2</code>. 
For the default  value of <code>POWHEG:pTemt = 0</code>, only 
<code>POWHEG:QEDveto = 2</code> has any effect. For this choice, a 
hard photon and subsequent QCD radiation is retained. In many cases, 
particularly when the Born contributions are small, the choice has 
little effect. 
 
<p/> 
You need to decide how many emissions the vetoed shower should check 
after an allowed emission has been constructed. If the hardness 
definitions in POWHEG-BOX and PYTHIA 8 where identical, all checking 
could be stopped after the first allowed PS emission. To be prudent, 
we recommend setting 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <code>POWHEG:vetoCount = 3</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
which will then check up to three allowed emissions. Higher values of 
<code>POWHEG:vetoCount</code> have not lead to visible differences 
for the processes which have been tested. 
 
<p/> 
For many POWHEG processes, the Sudakov effects from electroweak 
emissions (here we are concerned mainly with photon emissions, but this could 
apply also to W/Z emissions) are not included. This effect can be 
investigated using <code>POWHEG:QEDveto = 0,1,</code> or <code>2</code>. 
For the default  value of <code>POWHEG:pTemt = 0</code>, only 
<code>POWHEG:QEDveto = 2</code> has any effect. For this choice, a 
hard photon and subsequent QCD radiation is retained. In many cases, 
particularly when the Born contributions are small, the choice has 
little effect. 
 
<p/> 
In cases in which there can be an interplay between the fixed-order 
calculation and ISR branchings which are not modelled by the shower, such 
as <i>g &rarr; t tbar</i>, a damped shower may improve the modelling 
[<a href="Bibliography.html#refCor10" target="page">Cor10</a>]. In the simple shower and in Vincia, damped showers are 
steered by the <code>SpaceShower:pTdampMatch</code> (for ISR only) and 
<code>Vincia:pTdampMatch</code> (for both ISR and FSR) modes, 
respectively.  Their default settings 
<br/> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>SpaceShower:pTdampMatch = 3</code> 
<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<code>Vincia:pTdampMatch = 3</code> 
<br/> 
<br/> 
turn on damped showers in cases where heavy coloured particles are 
present in the final state, but switch them off otherwise. The 
undamped shower can be recovered for all processes by setting this 
mode to <code>0</code>.

Note that the modes have generally been defined with several default values 
below corresponding to the "off" state, and thus do not agree with the 
recommended values described above. 
 
<a name="anchor1"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:nFinal &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>-1</strong></code>; <code>minimum = -1</code>)<br/>
Number of outgoing particles of POWHEG Born level process, i.e. not 
counting additional POWHEG radiation.  The negative default value is 
interpreted as the instruction to ignore final state particle count 
conditions, as is e.g. necessary when the POWHEG-BOX code includes a 
variable number of additional emission (on top of the Born process) 
into the input events. Note that for this negative default value, only 
<code>POWHEG:pThard = 0</code> is allowed. 
   
 
<a name="anchor2"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:veto &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 1</code>)<br/>
Master switch to perform vetoing or not. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : No vetoing is performed (the user hooks is not loaded). 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : Showers are started at the kinematical limit. 
Emissions are vetoed if <i>pTemt > pThard</i>. 
See also <code>POWHEG:vetoCount</code> below.   
   
 
<a name="anchor3"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:pThard &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
Selection of the <i>pThard</i> scale. For events where there is no 
radiation, <i>pThard</i> is always set to be the <code>SCALUP</code> 
value of the LHA/LHEF standard. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : Set <i>pThard</i> equal to <code>SCALUP</code>. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : The <i>pT</i> of the POWHEG emission is tested against 
all other incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value chosen. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : The <i>pT</i> of all final-state partons is tested 
against all other incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value 
chosen.   
   
 
<a name="anchor4"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:pTdef &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
Use of <i>pT</i> definitions. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : The POWHEG ISR <i>pT</i> definition for 
both ISR and FSR.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : The POWHEG ISR <i>pT</i> and FSR <i>d_ij</i> 
definitions.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : The PYTHIA definitions. (Note that this does not 
make sense for <code>POWHEG:pThard = 0</code>.)   
   
 
<a name="anchor5"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:emitted &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 3</code>)<br/>
Selection of emitted parton for FSR. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : The PYTHIA definition of emitted.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : The PYTHIA definition of radiator.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : A random selection of emitted or radiator.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 3</strong> : Both emitted and radiator are tried.   
   
 
<a name="anchor6"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:pTemt &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
Selection of the <i>pTemt</i> scale. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : It is the <i>pT</i> of the emitted parton with respect 
to the radiating parton.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : The <i>pT</i> of the emission is checked against all 
incoming and outgoing partons, and then <i>pTemt</i> is set to the 
minimum of these values.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : The <i>pT</i> of all final-state partons is tested 
against all other incoming and outgoing partons, with the minimal value 
chosen.   
<br/><b>Warning:</b> the choice here can give significant variations 
in the final distributions, notably in the tail to large <i>pT</i> values. 
   
 
<a name="anchor7"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:QEDveto &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
Treatment of non-QCD radiation. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : Colorless partons are not included in <i> pT </i> 
  calculated from the shower for <i> pTemt>0 </i>.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : Colorless partons ARE included for <i> pTemt>0 </i>. 
     
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : Colorless partons ARE included for <i> pTemt>0 </i>. 
  Additionally, if a colorless parton is emitted with <i> pT > pThard </i> 
  in Born-level events, then the entire event is accepted. 
  This is relevant for all values of <i> pTemt </i>. 
   
   
 
<a name="anchor8"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:MPIveto &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 1</code>)<br/>
MPI vetoing. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : No MPI vetoing is done.   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : When there is no radiation, MPIs with a scale above 
<i>pT_1</i> are vetoed, else MPIs with a scale above 
<i>sum_i pT_i / 2 = (pT_1 + pT_2 + pT_3) / 2</i> are vetoed. 
This option is intended specifically for POWHEG simulations of 
<i>2 &rarr; 2 + 2 &rarr; 3</i> QCD processes. 
   
   
 
<a name="anchor9"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> POWHEG:vetoCount &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>3</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>)<br/>
After this many accepted emissions in a row, no more emissions 
are checked. Value 0 means that no emissions are checked. Using a very 
large value (e.g. 100000) will mean that all emissions are checked.
