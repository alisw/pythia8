This page describes a few simple hadron (re)scattering models. 
They are intended to take into account 
that the overlap of multiple strings at low transverse dimensions 
is likely to lead to some collective effects, not unlike those 
observed in heavy-ion collisions, even if not quite as pronounced. 
Specifically, it is assumed that the hadrons produced can scatter 
against each other on the way out, before the fragmenting system 
has had time to expand enough that the hadrons get free. Thereby 
heavier particles are shifted to higher transverse momenta, at the 
expense of the lighter ones. 
 
<p/> 
The main switch on/off switch for rescattering is 
<code>HadronLevel:HadronScatter</code>, which by the default is off, 
since all models are rather simplistic and have to be used 
with some caution. Currently there are three different options available: 
 
<a name="anchor1"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:mode &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
The first two options are variations of the same model, whereas 
option 2 respresents a different model. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> :  The new model, based on separation in rapidity 
as described in [<a href="Bibliography.html#refFis16" target="page">Fis16</a>]. 
Further options are found <a href="#HadScatNew1">here</a>. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> :  The new model, based on separation in rapidity 
and azimuthal angle as described in [<a href="Bibliography.html#refFis16" target="page">Fis16</a>]. Further options 
are found  <a href="#HadScatNew2">here</a>. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> :  The old model. Further options are found 
<a href="#HadScatOld">here</a>. 
<br/><b>Warning:</b> Option 2 is still at an experimental level, 
and should not be used unless you know what you are doing.

<h3>The New Model for Hadron Scattering</h3> 
 
Within the new model, there are two options available for how hadron 
pairs are found: 
 
<a name="HadScatNew1"></a> 
<h4>Rapidity based</h4> 
This corresponds to <code>HadronScatter:mode = 0</code>. 
<p/> 
Probe all hadron pairs with an invariant mass <i> m<sub>inv</sub> &lt; 
(m<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>+p<sup>2</sup><sub>Max</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> + 
(m<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>+p<sup>2</sup><sub>Max</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup></i> 
with the parameter <i>p<sub>Max</sub></i> 
<a name="anchor2"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:pMax &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0.5</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.1</code>; <code>maximum = 1000000.0</code>)<br/>
   
<br/> 
If a hadron pair passes this cut, the scattering probability for hadrons of 
different strings is <i>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y) = 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub>(1 - &#x394y/&#x394y<sup>max</sup>)</i> 
with rapidity difference <i>&#x394y</i> of the hadron pair and the 
parameters <i>&#x394y<sup>max</sup></i> 
<a name="anchor3"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:yDiffMax &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1.0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.1</code>; <code>maximum = 10.0</code>)<br/>
   
<br/> 
and <i>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></i>, see 
<a href="#HadScatNewCom">below</a>. If the hadrons are produced 
within the same string the probability is <i>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y) 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>SS</sub></i> if the hadrons are further apart from each 
other as <code>HadronScatter:neighbourFar</code>, <i>0</i> if they are 
closer together as <code>HadronScatter:neighbourNear</code>, and linear 
between the maximum <code>HadronScatter:maxProbSS</code> and minimum 
probability <code>HadronScatter:minProbSS</code> inbetween. 
 
<a name="HadScatNew2"></a> 
<h4>Rapidity and Azimuth based</h4> 
This corresponds to <code>HadronScatter:mode = 1</code>. 
<p/> 
All hadron pairs are considered. The scattering probability for hadrons 
of different strings is <i>P<sub>DS</sub>(&#x394y,&#x394&#x3C6) = 
P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub>(1 - ((&#x394y)<sup>2</sup> 
+(&#x394&#x3C6)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>/R<sup>max</sup>)</i> 
with rapidity difference <i>&#x394y</i> and difference in azimuth 
<i>&#x394&#x3C6</i> of the hadron pair and the 
parameters <i>R<sup>max</sup></i> 
<a name="anchor4"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:Rmax &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1.0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.1</code>; <code>maximum = 10.0</code>)<br/>
   
<br/> 
and <i>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></i>, see 
<a href="#HadScatNewCom">below</a>. 
The probability for hadron pairs from the same string is similar 
to the one before. 
 
<a name="HadScatNewCom"></a> 
<h4>Common Parameters</h4> 
 
The following paramters are used for both the above cases: 
<a name="anchor5"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:scatterSameString &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>on</strong></code>)<br/>
  If switched on, strings within the same string are allowed to 
  scatter off each other. Otherwise only hadron pairs that are 
  not produced on the same string are taken into account. 
   
 
<a name="anchor6"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:scatterMultipleTimes &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>on</strong></code>)<br/>
  If switched off, each hadron is only allowed to scatter at most once. 
  By the way that possible scattering pairs are considered in order of 
  increasing rapidity separation, this introduces a bias towards pairs 
  with small <i>y</i> separation. 
   
 
<a name="anchor7"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:maxProbDS &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0.5</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.0</code>; <code>maximum = 1.0</code>)<br/>
  The maximum probability <i>P<sup>max</sup><sub>DS</sub></i> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons that are not part of the same string. 
   
 
<a name="anchor8"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:neighbourNear &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>2</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 1</code>; <code>maximum = 10</code>)<br/>
  If scattering of hadrons within the same string is allowed this 
  parameter gives the closest neighbour that is allowed. The value 1 
  corresponds to the direct neighbour. The probability associated 
  with this potential scattering partner is <code>minProbSS</code>. 
   
 
<a name="anchor9"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:neighbourFar &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>4</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 2</code>; <code>maximum = 15</code>)<br/>
  If scattering of hadrons within the same string is allowed this 
  parameter gives the neighbour starting from which the maximum 
  probability <code>maxProbSS</code> is applied. 
   
 
<a name="anchor10"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:minProbSS &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0.5</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.0</code>; <code>maximum = 1.0</code>)<br/>
  The minimum probability <i>P<sup>min</sup><sub>SS</sub></i> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons within the same string. (Relative to that for 
  different strings, i.e. for the total probability the baseline 
  <code>maxProbDS</code> factor also enters.) 
   
 
<a name="anchor11"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:maxProbSS &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1.0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.0</code>; <code>maximum = 1.0</code>)<br/>
  The maximum probability <i>P<sup>max</sup><sub>SS</sub></i> for the 
  scattering of two hadrons within the same string. (Relative to that for 
  different strings, i.e. for the total probability the baseline 
  <code>maxProbDS</code> factor also enters.) 
   
 
<a name="HadScatOld"></a> 
<a name="section1"></a> 
<h3>The Old Model for Hadron Scattering</h3> 
 
<br/><b>Warning:</b> This is still at an experimental level, 
and should not be used unless you know what you are doing. 
 
<a name="anchor12"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:afterDecay &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Perform hadron scattering before or after first round of decays, 
involving very short-lived particles like the <i>rho</i>. 
The default is to perform scattering directly after the 
string fragmentation, before any decays. 
   
 
<a name="anchor13"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:allowDecayProd &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Allow two hadrons with same parent hadron to scatter. 
   
 
<a name="anchor14"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:scatterRepeat &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Allow hadrons which have already scattered to scatter again. 
Even if switched on, the same pair can not scatter off each 
other twice. 
   
 
<h4>Hadron selection</h4> 
 
<a name="anchor15"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:hadronSelect &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 0</code>)<br/>
Probability that a hadron is soft enough to scatter. 
(A high-<i>pT</i> hadron presumably being part of a jet, 
and thus produced away from the high-particle-density region 
at small transverse dimensions.) 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> :  
<i>P = N exp(-pT^2 / 2 / sigma^2) / 
  ( (1 - k) exp(-pT^2 / 2 / sigma^2) + k pT0^p / (pT0^2 + pT^2)^(p/2), </i> 
with <i>sigma = 2 StringPT:sigma</i> and <i>pT0</i> the same as that 
used in <i>MultipartonInteractions</i>. 
   
   
 
<a name="anchor16"></a>

<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:p &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>6</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 2</code>; <code>maximum = 30</code>)<br/>
<i>p</i> parameter as above. 
   
 
<h4>Scattering probability</h4> 
 
<a name="anchor19"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:scatterProb &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0</code>; <code>maximum = 2</code>)<br/>
Probability for a pair of hadrons to scatter. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : All hadrons scatter with probability 
<i>j max(0, 1 - dR^2 / rMax^2)</i>. Angular distribution 
is picked flat in <i>cos(theta).</i>   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : As option 0, above, but only <i>pi-pi</i>, 
<i>pi-K</i> and <i>pi-p</i> scatterings are considered. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 2</strong> : Only <i>pi-pi</i>, <i>pi-K</i> and 
<i>pi-p</i> scatterings are considered, with probability 
given by <i>(1 - exp(-j sigEl)) max(0, 1 - dR^2 / rMax^2)</i>. 
The elastic cross sections and angular distributions are taken 
from the partial-wave distributions. 
   
   
 
<a name="anchor20"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:j &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0.5</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.0</code>; <code>maximum = 10.0</code>)<br/>

<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:rMax &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1.0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.1</code>; <code>maximum = 2.0</code>)<br/>
<i>rMax</i> parameter as above. 
   
 
<a name="anchor22"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronScatter:tile &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Use tiling in <i>(eta, phi)</i> to reduce number of pairwise tests. 
   
 
 
<a name="section2"></a> 
<h3>Hadron Production Vertices</h3> 
 
It is not trivial to define where in space-time that the primary 
hadrons are produced by the string fragmentation machinery. 
The basic strategy is well-defined in a 1+1-dimensional picture, 
as represented by a single straight string stretched between massless 
<i>q</i> and <i>qbar</i> endpoints [<a href="Bibliography.html#refAnd83" target="page">And83</a>]. Even so there 
is no unique definition of the production vertex of the hadron 
straddling two adjacent breakup vertices, and the transverse width 
of the string adds a further smearing. Some of that ambiguity is 
reflected in the options below. The major step in complexity comes 
with the introduction of more convoluted string topologies, however. 
Here the momentum-space description contains a number of ambiguities, 
notably for those hadrons that straddle two or more different string 
regions, that were only overcome by a set of reasonable simplifications 
[<a href="Bibliography.html#refSjo84" target="page">Sjo84</a>]. The space-time picture introduced here inherits 
all these problems, and thus many of the same prescriptions, but also 
require a few further simplifications and assumptions. 
 
<p/> 
Below the main switches and parameters of this picture are described. 
Note, however, that that the machinery is still under development and 
should be used with caution. 
 
<p/> 
When on, the machinery assigns space-time production vertices to all 
primary hadrons, i.e. those that are produced directly from the string 
breakups. These vertices can be read out by the <code>event[i].vProd()</code> 
method. Note that the length unit is mm, and mm/s for time. To study 
the hadronization process it is natural to cnvert to fm. The conversion 
constants <code>FM2MM</code> <i>= 10^12</i> and <code>MM2FM</code> 
<i>= 10^-12</i> are defined inside the <code>Pythia8</code> namespace, 
available in user programs that include <code>Pythia8/Pythia.h</code>. 
 
<p/> 
Secondary vertices are set in decays, but by default only for scales 
of the order of mm or above. That is, decays on the fm scale, like for 
<i>rho</i> mesons, then are not considered. When the machinery in this 
section is switched on, also such displacements are considered, see 
further <code>HadronVertex:rapidDecays</code> below. Do note that the factor 
<i>10^12</i> separation between fm and mm scales means that the two do 
not mix well, i.e. any contribution of the latter kind would leave 
little trace of the former when stored in double-precision real numbers. 
For this reason it is also not meaningful to combine studies of hadron 
production vertices with displaced <i>pp</i> collision vertices from 
the profile of the incoming bunches. 
 
<a name="anchor23"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> Fragmentation:setVertices &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Normally primary hadron production vertices are not set, but if 
on they are. In the latter case the further switches and parameters 
below provide more detailed choices. 
   
 
<a name="anchor24"></a>
<p/><code>mode&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:mode &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0</strong></code>; <code>minimum = -1</code>; <code>maximum = 1</code>)<br/>
The definition of hadron production points is not unique, and here 
three alternatives are considered: one early, one late and one in the 
middle. Further expressions below are written for a hadron <i>i</i> 
produced between two string vertices <i>i</i> and <i>i+1</i>. 
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 0</strong> : A hadron production point is defined as the middle 
point between the two breakup vertices, 
<i>v<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub> + v<sub>i+1</sub>)/2</i>. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> -1</strong> : An "early" hadron production, counted backwards to the 
point where a fictitious string oscillation could have begun that would 
have reached the two string breakup vertices above. Given the hadronic 
four-momentum <i>p<sup>h</sup></i> and the string tension <i>kappa</i>, 
this vertex would be 
<i>v<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub> + v<sub>i+1</sub>)/2 
- p<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> / (2 kappa)</i>. With this prescription is 
is possible to obtain a negative squared proper time, since the 
<i>p<sup>h</sup></i> contains a transverse-momentum smearing that 
does not quite match up with longitudinal-momentum string picture. 
In such cases the negative term is scaled down to give a vanishing 
proper time. 
   
<br/><code>option </code><strong> 1</strong> : A "late" hadron production, defined as the point 
where the two partons that form the hadron cross for the first time. 
The hadron momentum contribution then shifts sign relative to the previous 
option, 
<i>v<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = (v<sub>i</sub> + v<sub>i+1</sub>)/2 
+ p<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> / (2 kappa)</i>, 
and there is no problem with negative squared proper times. 
   
   
 
<a name="anchor25"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:kappa &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1.</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.5</code>; <code>maximum = 10.</code>)<br/>
The string tension <i>kappa</i> in units of GeV/fm, i.e. how much 
energy is stored in a string per unit length. 
   
 
<a name="anchor26"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:smearOn &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>on</strong></code>)<br/>
When on, the space--time location of breakp points is smear in transverse 
space accordingly to the value of xySmear given. 
   
 
<a name="anchor27"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:xySmear &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>0.7</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 0.</code>; <code>maximum = 2.</code>)<br/>
Transverse smearing of the hadron production vertices in units of fm. 
This is initially assigned as a Gaussian smearing of the string breakup 
vertices in the plane perpendicular to the string direction. 
The <i>xySmear</i> parameter is picked such that a breakup vertex 
should have a smearing <i>&lt;x^2 + y^2&gt; = xySmear^2</i> for a 
simple string along the <i>z</i> direction. The default value has 
been picked roughly like <i>sqrt(2/3)</i> of the proton radius, to 
represent two out of three spatial directions. For a hadron this is 
then averaged, as described above in <i>v<sup>h</sup><sub>i</sub> = 
(v<sub>i</sub> + v<sub>i+1</sub>)/2 </i> and its variants, 
giving a width reduction of 1/sqrt(2). 
   
 
<a name="anchor28"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:constantTau &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>on</strong></code>)<br/>
The transverse smearing might change either the time coordinate or 
the invariant time of the breakup points with respect to the origin. 
Normally, the <i>tau</i> is kept constant and the time coordinate is 
recalculated to compensate the effect of the smearing. If off, the 
time coordinate is kept constant and the invariant time is modified 
by the smearing. 
   
 
<a name="anchor29"></a>
<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:rapidDecays &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
The decay products of particles with short lifetimes, such as rho, should be 
displaced from the production point of the mother particle. When on, the 
corresponding displacement is included in the space--time location of the 
daughter production points. More specifically, the width stored for these 
particles are inverted to give the respective lifetimes. (Even more 
specifically, the width must be above <code>NARROWMASS</code> = 
<i>10^-6 GeV</i>.) Particles that by default already have a nonvanishing 
lifetime (in the database or set by the user) are always given a displaced 
vertex based on that value, so for them this flag makes no difference. 
See below for unstable particles that have neither a know width nor a 
known lifetime. 
   
 
<a name="anchor30"></a>
<p/><code>parm&nbsp; </code><strong> HadronVertex:intermediateTau0 &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>1e-9</strong></code>; <code>minimum = 1e-12</code>; <code>maximum = 1e-3</code>)<br/>
Average lifetime <i>c * tau_0</i>, expressed in mm, assigned to particle 
species which are unstable, but have neither been assigned a nonvanishing 
lifetime nor a non-negligible (above <code>NARROWMASS</code>) width. 
For such cases an intermediate scale is chosen, such that the decays happen 
well separated from the primary vertex, and yet not as far away as to give 
rise to an experimentally discernible secondary vertex. The default 
<i>10^-9 mm = 1000 fm</i> meets this requirement, and is additionally 
a reasonable value for the particles that mainly decay electromagnetically. 
The value is also used for a few rare particles that probably have a 
non-negligible width, but are so poorly known that no width is listed 
in the Review of Particle Physics.
