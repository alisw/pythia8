This page describes the random-number generator in PYTHIA and 
how it can be replaced by an external one. 
 
<a name="section0"></a> 
<h3>Internal random numbers</h3> 
 
The <code>Rndm</code> class generates random numbers, using the 
Marsaglia-Zaman-Tsang algorithm [<a href="Bibliography.html#refMar90" target="page">Mar90</a>]. 
 
<p/> 
Random numbers <code>R</code> uniformly distributed in 
<code>0 &lt; R &lt; 1</code> are obtained with 
<pre> 
   Rndm::flat(); 
</pre> 
There are also methods to generate according to an exponential, to 
<i>x * exp(-x)</i>, to a Gaussian, or picked among a set of 
possibilities, which make use of <code>flat()</code>. 
 
<p/> 
If the random number generator is not initialized before, it will be 
so the first time it is asked to generate a random number, and then 
with the default seed, 19780503. This means that, by default, all runs 
will use identically the same random number sequence. This is 
convenient for debugging purposes, but dangerous if you intend to 
run several "identical" jobs to boost statistics. You can initialize, 
or reinitialize, with your own choice of seed with a 
<pre> 
   Rndm::init(seed); 
</pre> 
Here values <code>0 &lt; seed &lt; 900 000 000</code> gives so many 
different random number sequences, while <code>seed = 0</code> will call 
the <code>Stdlib time(0)</code> function to provide a "random" 
<code>seed</code>, and <code>seed &lt; 0</code> will revert back to 
the default <code>seed</code>. 
 
<p/> 
The <code>Pythia</code> class defines <a href="RandomNumberSeed.html" target="page">a 
flag and a mode</a>, that allows the <code>seed</code> to be set in 
the <code>Pythia::init</code> call. That would be the standard way for a 
user to pick the random number sequence in a run. 
 
<a name="section1"></a> 
<h3>External random numbers</h3> 
 
<code>RndmEngine</code> is a base class for the external handling of 
random-number generation. The user-written derived class is called 
if a pointer to it has been handed in with the 
<code>pythia.rndmEnginePtr()</code> method. Since the default 
Marsaglia-Zaman-Tsang algorithm is quite good, chances are that any 
replacement would be a step down, but this may still be required by 
consistency with other program elements in big experimental frameworks. 
 
<p/> 
There is only one pure virtual method in <code>RndmEngine</code>, to 
generate one random number flat in the range between 0 and 1: 
<pre> 
  virtual double flat() = 0; 
</pre> 
Note that methods for initialization are not provided in the base 
class, in part since input parameters may be specific to the generator 
used, in part since initialization can as well be taken care of 
externally to the <code>Pythia</code> code. 
 
<p/> 
An example illustrating how to run with an external random number 
generator is provided in <code>main23.cc</code>. 
 
<a name="section2"></a> 
<h3>MIXMAX random numbers</h3> 
 
The MIXMAX class of random number generators utilizes 
matrix-recursion based on Anosov-Kolmogorov C-K systems, with the 
ability to create a large number of statistically independent 
sequences of random numbers based on different initial seeds. This is 
particularly advantageous in creating statistically independent 
samples when running a large number of parallel jobs, each with a 
different initial seed. In the plugin 
header <code>Pythia8Plugins/MixMax.h</code> an implementation of a 
MIXMAX random number generator is provided [<a href="Bibliography.html#refSav91" target="page">Sav91</a>,<a href="Bibliography.html#refSav15" target="page">Sav15</a>], 
courtesy of Konstantin Savvidy, as well as a PYTHIA interface through 
the <code>MixMaxRndm</code> class. 
 
In this implementation a dimensionality of 17 is used, as this has 
been found to provide faster access to large numbers of independent 
sequences. A timing comparison between the external MIXMAX random 
number generator, and the default internal PYTHIA random number 
generator is provided in the example <code>main23.cc</code>. The 
MIXMAX random number generator is found to be comparable in speed to 
the default generator. The primary methods of 
the <code>MixMaxRndm</code> class are given here. 
 
<a name="anchor1"></a>
<p/><strong> MixMaxRndm::MixMaxRndm(int seed0, int seed1, int seed2, int seed3) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
for the given four 32-bit seed numbers. The sequence of numbers 
produced from this set of seeds is guaranteed not to collide with 
another if at least one bit of the four seeds is different, and, less 
than <i>10^100</i> random numbers are thrown. 
   
 
<a name="section3"></a> 
<h3>The methods</h3> 
 
We here collect a more complete and formal overview of 
the <code>Rndm</code> class methods. 
 
<a name="anchor2"></a>
<p/><strong> Rndm::Rndm() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
construct a random number generator, but does not initialize it. 
   
 
<a name="anchor3"></a>
<p/><strong> Rndm::Rndm(int seed) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
construct a random number generator, and initialize it for the 
given seed number. 
   
 
<a name="anchor4"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::rndmEnginePtr( RndmEngine* rndmPtr) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
pass in pointer for external random number generation. 
   
 
<a name="anchor5"></a>
<p/><strong> void Rndm::init(int seed = 0) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
initialize, or reinitialize, the random number generator for the given 
seed number. Not necessary if the seed was already set in the constructor. 
   
 
<a name="anchor6"></a>
<p/><strong> double Rndm::flat() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate next random number uniformly between 0 and 1. 
   
 
<a name="anchor7"></a>
<p/><strong> double Rndm::exp() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate random numbers according to <i>exp(-x)</i>. 
   
 
<a name="anchor8"></a>
<p/><strong> double Rndm::xexp() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate random numbers according to <i>x exp(-x)</i>. 
   
 
<a name="anchor9"></a>
<p/><strong> double Rndm::gauss() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate random numbers according to <i>exp(-x^2/2)</i>. 
   
 
<a name="anchor10"></a>
<p/><strong> pair&lt;double, double&gt; Rndm::gauss2() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate a pair of random numbers according to 
<i>exp( -(x^2 + y^2) / 2)</i>. Is faster than two calls 
to <code>gauss()</code>. 
   
 
<a name="anchor11"></a>
<p/><strong> pair&lt;Vec4, Vec4&gt; Rndm::phaseSpace2(double eCM, double m1, double m2) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
generate a pair of vectors according to the phase space distribution of two 
particles at the specified eCM and with the specified masses. 
   
 
<a name="anchor12"></a>
<p/><strong> int Rndm::pick(const vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; prob) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
pick one option among vector of (positive) probabilities. 
   
 
<a name="anchor13"></a>
<p/><strong> void Rndm::shuffle(vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; vec) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
randomly shuffle a vector of objects (<code>type T</code>, i.e. any type, 
templated method) according to the Fisher-Yates algorithm. 
   
 
<a name="anchor14"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::dumpState(string fileName) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
save the current state of the random number generator to a binary 
file. This involves two integers and 100 double-precision numbers. 
Intended for debug purposes. Note that binary files may be 
platform-dependent and thus not transportable. 
   
 
<a name="anchor15"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::readState(string fileName) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
set the state of the random number generator by reading in a binary 
file saved by the above command. Comments as above. 
   
 
<a name="anchor16"></a>
<p/><strong> RndmState Rndm::getState() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
save the current state of the random number generator as a 
<code>struct RndmState</code>. This can then later be used within the 
same run, e.g. as input to another <code>Pythia</code> instance. 
It circumvents the intermediate file of <code>dumpState</code>, 
but cannot be saved for a later run. 
   
 
<a name="anchor17"></a>
<p/><strong> void Rndm::setState(RndmState&amp; state) &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
set the state of the random number generator by reading in a 
<code>struct RndmState</code> saved by the above command. 
Comments as above. 
   
 
<a name="anchor18"></a>
<p/><strong> virtual double RndmEngine::flat() &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
if you want to construct an external random number generator 
(or generator interface) then you must implement this method 
in your class derived from the <code>RndmEningen</code> base class, 
to give a random number between 0 and 1.

<h3>Random number debugging</h3> 
 
In some cases, when trying to determine where two different versions 
of the PYTHIA code might diverge, it can be useful to trace all random 
numbers that are used. In this way, it is possible to see exactly 
where a random sequence first diverges. An experimental random number 
number debugging tool is available for advanced debugging. This tool 
is only available when using the internal PYTHIA random number 
generation class, <code>Rndm</code>, and can be enabled by specifying 
the following during the configuration of PYTHIA. 
<pre> 
./configure --obj-common=-DRNGDEBUG 
</pre> 
Then, when building any of the examples, the random number debugging 
will be enabled. The output, for example when running 
<code>main01</code>, will look something like the following. 
<pre> 
ParticleDecays::twoBody:flat        3.5433e-01 src/ParticleDecays.cc:546 
Rndm::exp:flat                      2.7883e-01 src/Basics.cc:96 
Rndm::exp:flat                      7.8534e-01 src/Basics.cc:96 
ParticleDataEntry::pickChannel:flat 8.4012e-01 src/ParticleData.cc:542 
</pre> 
The printout is specified by the following format. 
<pre> 
Class::ClassMethod:RndmMethod RandomNumber Location:LineNumber 
</pre> 
Here, <code>Class</code> is the class where the random number is being 
called, <code>ClassMethod</code> is the method being called, and 
<code>RndmMethod</code> is the method of <code>Rndm</code> that is 
being called. This is followed by <code>RandomNumber</code> which is 
the random number which was returned by the method, and then 
<code>Location</code> which is the source file where the call was made 
from, and <code>LineNumber</code> the line number of the call. In some 
methods, more than just a single number is returned, for example 
<code>Rndm::phaseSpace2</code>. In this case, all the elements of the 
returned value are printed (here, four elements for two vectors). 
 
<p/> 
It is possible to control the output of the debugging with a number of 
statically defined variables. These variables can be modified in 
whatever code is being run. 
<a name="anchor19"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::debugNow &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This can be used to switch the debug statements on and off. If set to 
<code>false</code> then the debug statements will not be printed. If 
set to <code>true</code> (the default) they will be printed. In this 
way, printing of the debugging can be turned on only after a certain 
event has passed, for example. 
   
<a name="anchor20"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::debugLocation &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
By default, set to <code>true</code>. If set to <code>false</code> the 
location of the random number generator call within the source code 
will no longer be printed. This is useful when running a difference on 
two sets of output. 
   
<a name="anchor21"></a>
<p/><strong> bool Rndm::debugIndex &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
By default, set to <code>false</code>. If set to <code>true</code> the 
number of RNG calls will be counted, and the index of the RNG call 
will be printed. This can be useful when comparing two different 
outputs where other print statements have been inserted in the code. 
   
<a name="anchor22"></a>
<p/><strong> int Rndm::debugCall &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
This integer tracks the number of random number generation calls, and 
can be used to reset the index. 
   
<a name="anchor23"></a>
<p/><strong> int Rndm::debugPrecision &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
Sets the precision of the random number values being printed. By 
default, this is <code>4</code> but could be set to <code>17</code>, 
for example, to print the full precision of a double. 
   
 
<p/> 
Because there are a large number of random number calls within PYTHIA, 
one may wish to filter the output. This can be done by inserting 
filter strings into the following static variables. These filter 
strings are applied to the <code>Class::ClassMethod</code> portion of 
the output, and if any of the defined sets are found, then the RNG 
call is printed (an OR operation). 
<a name="anchor24"></a>
<p/><strong> set&lt;string&gt; Rndm::debugStarts &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
Print the call if the class name and method starts with this string. 
   
<a name="anchor25"></a>
<p/><strong> set&lt;string&gt; Rndm::debugEnds &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
Print the call if the class name and method ends with this string. 
   
<a name="anchor26"></a>
<p/><strong> set&lt;string&gt; Rndm::debugContains &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
Print the call if the class name and method contains this string. 
   
<a name="anchor27"></a>
<p/><strong> set&lt;string&gt; Rndm::debugContains &nbsp;</strong> <br/>
Print the call if the class name and method exactly matches this string. 
   
For example, the following code only keeps calls if they begin with 
<code>SimpleTimeShower</code> or <code>SimpleSpaceShower</code>. 
<pre> 
Rndm::debugStarts.insert("SimpleTimeShower"); 
Rndm::debugStarts.insert("SimpleSpaceShower"); 
</pre> 
 
<p/> 
There are some limitations to the tool. The biggest is that this level 
of debugging is only possible when the <code>Rndm</code> method name 
is not used elsewhere in the PYTHIA code. For example, the 
<code>exp</code> method is used also as just the standard 
exponential. This means that whenever <code>Rndm::exp</code> is 
called, the location from where it was called can no longer be 
reported, only that this method was called, and what value it produced 
(this can be seen in the example above). In the PYTHIA code, this also 
currently applies to the <code>pick</code> and <code>shuffle</code> 
methods. This similarly applies to user code. If <code>flat</code> is 
used as a method name in user code, than compiling with the 
<code>-DRNGDEBUG</code> flag will result in the code failing to 
compile. This can be overcome by including the 
<code>include/Pythia8/RngDebug.h</code> header after any PYTHIA 
headers, but before any additional headers. As an example, 
<code>main93</code> will fail to compile with RNG debugging 
on. However, the following modification in <code>main93.cc</code> 
resolves the issue. 
<pre> 
#include "Pythia8/Pythia.h" 
#include "Pythia8/HeavyIons.h" 
#include "Pythia8/RngDebug.h" 
#include "Pythia8Plugins/Pythia8Rivet.h" 
</pre> 
Here, <code>RngDebug.h</code> has been included after the last PYTHIA 
header, but before additional headers.
