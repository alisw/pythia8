<h1>PYTHIA 8</h1> 
 
<h3>Welcome to PYTHIA - The Lund Monte Carlo!</h3> 
 
<p/> 
PYTHIA is a general-purpose event generator for high-energy particle 
collisions. PYTHIA 8 is the successor to PYTHIA 6, rewritten from 
scratch in C++. It includes many new features, but rests on the same 
historical physics base, including concepts such as soft and hard 
processes, parton showers, multiparton interactions and string 
fragmentation. With the current PYTHIA 8.3 version the step has been 
taken from <code>C++98</code> to <code>C++11</code>, but the 
transition from 8.2 should largely be transparent to users. Also 
several new physics features are made available. 
 
<h3>Documentation</h3> 
 
On these webpages you will find the manual for PYTHIA 8.3. The physics 
descriptions may in places still need to be updated, but the 
documentation of available settings and other practical details should 
be fully up-to-date. Use the left-hand index to navigate this 
documentation of program elements, especially of all possible program 
settings. All parameters are provided with sensible default values, 
however, so you need only change those of relevance to your particular 
study, such as choice of beams, processes and phase space cuts. The 
pages also contain a fairly extensive survey of all methods available 
to the user, e.g. to study the produced events. What is lacking on 
these webpages is an overview, on the one hand, and an in-depth 
physics description, on the other. 
 
<p/> 
The overview can be found in the attached PDF file 
<br/><a href="../pdfdoc/pythia8200.pdf" target="page"> 
<b>An Introduction to PYTHIA 8.2</b></a> 
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand et al, Comput. Phys.Commun. 191 (2015) 159 
[arXiv:1410.3012 [hep-ph]]. 
<br/>You are strongly recommended to read this summary when you 
start out to learn how to use PYTHIA 8.2. 
 
<p/> 
For the physics description we refer to the complete 
<br/><b>PYTHIA 6.4 Physics and Manual</b> 
<br/>T. Sj&ouml;strand, S. Mrenna and P. Skands, JHEP05 (2006) 026, 
<br/>which in detail describes the physics (largely) implemented also in 
PYTHIA 8, and also provides a more extensive bibliography than found 
here. When you use PYTHIA 8.2, you should therefore cite both. 
 
<p/> 
Furthermore, a separate 
<br/><a href="../pdfdoc/worksheet8200.pdf" target="page"> 
<b>PYTHIA 8.2 Worksheet</b></a>, 
<br/>also an attached PDF file, offers a practical introduction to 
using the generator. It has been developed for and used at a few 
summer schools, with minor variations, but is also suited for 
self-study.
