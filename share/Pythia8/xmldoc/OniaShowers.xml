<h2>Onia Showers</h2> 
 
Measurements of onium isolation, see <ref>LHC17</ref>, indicate that onium 
production cannot be sufficiently described by the hard processes of 
<aloc href="OniaProcesses">Onia Processes</aloc> alone. Instead, the 
formation of onium states could occur later in the event at lower 
energy scales, described either through the formalism of fragmentation 
functions or parton showers. Consequently, the LETO project (named 
after the mother of the twins Apollo and Artemis) has implemented the 
production of onia within the simple 
<aloc href="OniaProcesses">Timelike Showers</aloc> framework of PYTHIA. A 
full description of the LETO implementation can be found in 
<ref>Coo23</ref>. Production of any <ei>1S0</ei>, <ei>3S1</ei>, and 
<ei>3PJ</ei> charmonium and bottomonium states via the colour-singlet 
and colour-octet mechanisms is available via the LETO parton 
shower. This includes by default, but is not limited to, production of 
the <ei>1S0</ei> <ei>eta</ei> states, the <ei>3S1</ei> 
<ei>J/psi</ei> and <ei>Upsilon</ei> and their radially excited states, 
as well as the <ei>3PJ</ei> <ei>chi</ei> states. <note>Warning:</note> 
matching between onium production from the hard processes and from 
LETO is not available, and consequently both LETO processes and onium 
hard processes should not be used at the same time as this will result 
in double counting. Indeed, it is expected that given a sufficiently 
complete set of splittings in LETO, hard process production should not 
be necessary. By default, hard process onium production is included in 
multi-parton interactions. If the onium shower is enabled, these onium 
processes are automatically no longer included in the multi-parton 
interactions. <note>Warning:</note> due to the large number of 
splittings onium shower introduces, as well as current inefficiencies 
in the samplings for some of the splittings, the runtime for Pythia 
can increase significantly when onia showers are turned on; depending 
on what splittings are enabled as well as the beam configuration, the 
code can run up to five times slower. 
 
<p/> 
Only the lowest-order colour-octet production mechanisms for these 
three spin configurations are provided via splittings into 
<ei>3S1</ei> colour-octet states. The gluon initiated splittings of 
this type are unusual in the context of a parton shower, as they are 
<ei>1 &rarr; 1</ei> processes, rather than the typical <ei>1 &rarr; 
2</ei> processes. These splittings are treated as delta functions; if 
a gluon reaches the virtuality of an onium state, then such a 
colour-octet state may form. The result is to produce colour-octet 
states nearer to the end of the shower. Note that colour-octet states 
may also be produced in the splitting <ei> Q &rarr; (onium) Q</ei> 
where the colour-octet state is an unphysical <ei>3S1</ei> state that 
evolves to a <ei>3PJ</ei> state <ref>Yua94</ref>. However, this 
process is sub-leading to the gluon initiated colour-octet 
process. For colour-singlet production (<ref>Bra93</ref>, 
<ref>Bra93a</ref>, <ref>Bra94</ref>, <ref>Bra95</ref>, and 
<ref>Yua94</ref>), both gluon and heavy-flavour quark initiated 
splittings are available. For the <ei>3S1</ei> colour-singlet state, 
the gluon initiated splitting is a <ei>1 &rarr; 3</ei> process, 
i.e. <ei>g &rarr; (onium) g g</ei> as required by the Landau-Yang 
theorem. 
 
<p/> 
Whenever possible, the same notation and settings structure as 
<aloc href="OniaProcesses">Onia Processes</aloc> is used. In 
principle, the same long-distance NRQCD matrix elements (LDMEs) that 
are used for the hard processes should also be used for the splittings 
of the LETO parton shower. However, for full flexibility, these LDMEs 
are specified independently for LETO and the hard processes. However, 
their default values are matched to those of the hard process LDMEs 
whenever possible. For consistency, all LDMEs are given in units of 
<ei>GeV^3</ei>. For the case of the <ei>3PJ</ei> states, where the 
LDME units are typically <ei>GeV^5</ei>, the LDME provided to LETO should 
be divided by the squared mass of the heavy-flavour quark, 
<ei>&lt;O[3P0(1)]&gt;/m_Q^2</ei>. For the colour-octet states, the 
same particle ID convention as in <aloc href="OniaProcesses">Onia 
Processes</aloc> is used, with the mass splitting between the 
colour-octet and physical colour-singlet states set by the 
<code>Onia:massSplit</code> parameter. Here, only the leading 
splittings into colour-octet <ei>3S1(8)</ei> states are included, and 
so the notation is somewhat simpler than for the hard processes, where 
both <ei>1S0(8)</ei> and <ei>3PJ(8)</ei> processes are included for 
the physical colour-singlet <ei>3S1(1)</ei> states. 
 
<h3>Radiation off octet onium states</h3> 
 
In the current implementation, charmonium and bottomonium production 
can proceed either through colour-singlet or colour-octet mechanisms, 
either through <ei>2 &rarr; 2</ei> hard processes such as <ei>g g 
&rarr; (onium) g</ei>, or via splittings like <ei>g &rarr; (onium) 
g</ei> in the LETO parton shower. For colour-singlet production, the 
state does not radiate and the onium therefore is produced in 
isolation if produced from the hard process, up to normal 
underlying-event activity. If produced from the parton shower, the 
onium will be present within a jet, but will not radiate any further 
after being produced. For colour-octet states the situation is not so 
clear, but it is sensible to assume that such states can radiate 
further in the shower, assuming, of course, that the transverse 
momentum of the onium state is sufficiently high that radiation is of 
relevance. Consequently, colour-octet states produced either in the 
hard process or in the parton shower may be allowed to radiate 
further. 
 
<p/> 
When an octet onium state radiates, there is a choice of splitting 
kernel for this process. The first and perhaps most natural choice is 
to assume the octet onium state radiates like a massive gluon, 
i.e. <ei>q &rarr; q g</ei>, while the second choice is to assume that 
the full radiation is provided by an incoherent sum of radiation off 
the quark and off the antiquark of the onium state. Thus the splitting 
kernel for this second option is taken to be the normal <ei>Q &rarr; Q 
g</ei> one, multiplied by a factor of two. Obviously this is a 
simplification of a more complex picture, averaging over factors 
pulling in different directions. Firstly, radiation off a gluon ought 
to be enhanced by a factor 9/4 relative to a quark rather than 
2. Secondly, our use of the <ei>q &rarr; q g</ei> branching kernel is 
roughly equivalent to always following the harder gluon in a <ei>g 
&rarr; g g</ei> branching.  This could give us a bias towards 
producing too hard onia. A soft gluon would have little phase space to 
branch into a heavy-quark pair however, so the bias may not be as big 
as it would seem at first glance. 
 
<p/> 
Finally, note that the lower cutoff scale of the shower evolution 
depends on the onium mass rather than on the quark mass, as it should 
be. Gluons below the octet-onium scale should only be part of the 
octet-to-singlet transition.
